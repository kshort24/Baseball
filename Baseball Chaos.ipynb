    "`baseball_scraper` is a Python package for baseball data analysis. This package scrapes baseball-reference.com and baseballsavant.com so you don't have to. So far, the package performs four main tasks: retrieving statcast data, pitching stats, batting stats, and division standings/team records. Data is available at the individual pitch level, as well as aggregated at the season level and over custom time periods. \n",
